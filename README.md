## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
<h3></h3>
<ul><li>Detailed explanation of the proposed solution
Farmers, especially small and marginal ones, often struggle with choosing the right crops, applying the correct amount of fertilizer, or handling pests and diseases. Our solution is a smart mobile app and chatbot that acts like a personal agricultural advisor for each farmer. It’s designed to be simple, practical, and helpful, even for those who may not be tech-savvy.

How It Works

Personalized Crop Advice
The app suggests which crops a farmer should grow based on their soil type, local weather, and past crop history. It also tells them the best time to plant, irrigate, and harvest. This way, farmers can make smart choices instead of guessing.

Soil & Fertilizer Guidance
Farmers can enter results from soil tests, and the app recommends what kind of fertilizer to use and how much, preventing overuse and saving money. It even suggests organic alternatives to keep the soil healthy.

Pest and Disease Help
If a farmer notices damaged crops, they can take a photo and upload it. The app uses AI to detect the problem and gives simple instructions to fix it. No more relying on guesswork or local shopkeepers who may not always be right.

Weather Alerts
The app sends alerts about rain, heat, or other extreme weather. This helps farmers protect their crops and plan activities like irrigation or harvesting.

Market Price Updates
Farmers can check real-time prices for their crops in local markets. This helps them sell at the right time and earn better profits.

Voice and Local Language Support
Understanding technology can be hard, so the app offers voice guidance in regional languages, making it easy for everyone, even those who can’t read well.

Learning and Feedback
The more farmers use the app, the smarter it gets. Their feedback and crop results help improve the advice for everyone.

Why It Helps

Farmers get better yields and lower costs.

They make informed decisions instead of relying on guesswork.

It encourages sustainable farming by reducing chemical overuse.

Families and communities benefit from improved income and food security.

Government and research institutions can use the data for better planning and support.</li>
